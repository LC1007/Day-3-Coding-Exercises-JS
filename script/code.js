// JS Data Type Exercise

// 1. Make a variable with a data of a string and check the type of this variable.

let firstName = "Justin"
console.log(typeof firstName);

// 2. Reassign the value to a number and check the type again. Did it change?

firstName = 24
console.log(typeof firstName);

// 3. Go ahead and create a variable with every data type you know of. Double check that you covered all of them by using the typeof check.

let fullName = "John Doe"
console.log(typeof fullName);

let salary = 15000
console.log(typeof salary);

let jobAccepted = true
console.log(typeof jobAccepted);

let something = undefined
console.log(typeof something);

let empty = null
console.log(typeof empty);

let list = ["Microsoft","Mac","Windows","Laptop","Desktop"]
console.log(typeof list);

let personDetails = [{
    firstName: "John",
    lastName: "Doe",
    fullName: "John Doe",
    age: 30
}]
console.log(typeof personDetails);
